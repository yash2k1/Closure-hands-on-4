 function counter(){
    var counter = 0;

    function IncreaseCounter() {
        return counter += 1;
    };

    return IncreaseCounter;
}

var counter = counter();
alert(counter());
alert(counter());
alert(counter());
alert(counter());

                <div id="ans1" class="ans">
                    4 time alert is shown with counter value 1,2,3,4 respectivly <br>
                    EXPLANATION - when counter() function is being called then it return the IncreaseCounter() function
                    and a counter variable (local variable) because of closure
                    and when the couter() (global first class function) function is being called inside the alert it run
                    IncreaseCounter() function that has use a counter variable which is not in the
                    IncreaseCounter's local memory so it starts finding in the lexical scope and due to closure it uses
                    the counter variable (local variable of counter() function) and increase its value and also update
                    the counter variable.
                    then again alert(counter()); is being call which increase the value of counter (local variable of
                    closure) whos value is increased by 1 because of the previous alert(counter()); so in increase the
                    value of counter variable.

            <!-- Question 2 -->

            <div class="container ">
                <div class="question">Q2.


                    <pre>
"let count = 0;
(function () {
    if (count === 0) {
        let count = 1;
        console.log(count); // What is logged?
    }
    console.log(count); // What is logged?
})();"
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <div id="ans2" class="ans">
                    1 <br>
                    0 <br>
                    EXPLANATION - There is count in the if condition, so to find the the value of count is search in the
                    lexical scope where count =0 (a global variable) so, condition is satisfied
                    now 1 st console .log(count) will print with the value of 1 because of the local variable in the
                    local memory (let count=1) then another console.log(count) will search for count and
                    it prints count 0.
                </div>

            <!-- Question 3 -->

            <div class="container">
                <div class="question"> Q3.
                    <pre>
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    setTimeout(function log() {
      console.log(i); // What is logged?
    }, 1000);
  }
        </pre>
                </div>
                <div class="ans">
                   <div id="ans3"></div>
                   <button onclick="ans3Fun()"> Run</button> <br>

                    In case of var you are always referring to the same variable address, because var is function scoped.
                    i will be hoisted, to look like this :
                    <pre>
                        var i;
                        for ( i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
                            setTimeout(function log() {
                              console.log(i); // What is logged?
                            }, 1000);
                          }
                    </pre>
                    After the loop get's over , it will run setTimeOut for 3 times which will print value of i which is now 3

            <!-- Question 4 -->

            <div class="container ">
                <div class="question">Q4.
                    Write a code to calculate area of a rectangle using inner function. In this case outer function
                    should accept parameter length and inner function should accept parameter breadth.
                </div>
                <div class="ans">
                    <pre>
 function findArea(l) {
     return function area(b) {
       console.log(l * b);
     };
   }
   const func1 = findArea(<span id="l"></span>);
   func1(<span id="b"></span>);

    <button id="ans4Btn" onclick="areaOfRectangle()">area</button>
        <div id="ans4"></div>

                    EXPLANATION - here we are using the concept of closure . when we give length value to the findArea()
                    as a paramenter
                    and call it it return area(b) function with the length value because of closure and when we call
                    func1 then
                    area () is being called and it take the value of breadth from local memory and length value from
                    lexical scopeand print
                    the Length*breadth.

                    Q5.
                    Take a variable in outer function and create an inner function to increase the counter every time it
                    is called.

                    EXPLANATION - when counter() function is being called then it return the IncreaseCounter() function
                    and a counter variable (local variable) because of closure
                    and when the func2() (global first class function) function is being called it run IncreaseCounter()
                    function that has use a counter variable which is not in the
                    IncreaseCounter's local memory so it starts finding in the lexical scope and due to closure it uses
                    the counter variable (local variable of counter() function) and increase its value and also update
                    the counter variable.
                    then again func2(); is being call which increase the value of counter (local variable of closure)
                    who's value is increased by 1 because of the previous func2() so in increase the value of counter
                    variable.

                    EXPLANATION - we have Self-Invoking Functions which alert with the value of a and the value of is

                    EXPLANATION - There is a Self-Invoking Functions which return an anonimous function and a variable
                    with value 12 to x and when x is call
                    it alert with value a which comming from the lexical environment

                    EXPLANATION - There 2 Self-Invoking Functions (outerFunc and innerFunc)when outerFunc is call with
                    the Argument value of 123 then innerFunc() function is being called with 456 during the
                    console.log() outerArg value is 123 thst is pass in the outerFunc as a paramenter and innerArg value
                    is 456 thst is pass in the innnerFunc as a paramenter and outerVar is value is 'a'
                    that value is found in the lexical scope of the innerFunc and innerVar value is 'b' as it is in the
